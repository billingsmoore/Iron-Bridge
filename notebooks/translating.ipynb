Here I've used the Greedy sampler which simply finds the highest likelihood next word and adds it to the translated sentence. It is computationally inexpensive and because the outputs are pretty short we don't need to worry about the Greedy sampler outputting long, repetitive sentences that don't make much sense, which can be an issue with the algorithm."
