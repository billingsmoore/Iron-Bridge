# Model Training

The architecture that was used for model training was Google's T5. The size used was the 'Large' model with 770 million parameters. The original model can be found on Huggingface as google-t5/t5-large.

This model was trained for 6 epochs on a set of 1 million sentence pairs, with an additional set of 100,000 sentence pairs used for evaluation. It was then trained for 1 additional epoch on a set of 10 million sentence pairs with a separate set of 100,000 sentence pairs for evaluation.

## Training Results

## Example Translations

### 'A Brief Amitabha Sleeping Practive

For an example translation, we can use again 'A Brief Amitabha Sleeping Practice' by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö. However, this time, I've provided a full translation of the text side by side with Adam Pearcey's original translation.
